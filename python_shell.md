# 2. Using IPython as a pocket calculator

Enter Python in the interactive mode. You should see a message

    In [1]:

Complete the following calculations by filling in the blanks:

    In [1]: 1 + ___
    Out[1]: 3

    In [2]: 12 ___ 8
    Out[2]: 4

    In [3]: ___ * 5
    Out[3]: 20

    In [4]: 21 / 7
    Out[4]: ___

    In [5]: ___ ** 2
    Out[5]: 81

Enter the commands to see what happens (**do not** type the first part `In [1]` etc., these will appear automatically).

## Definitions

### IPython shell

The IPython shell allows you to enter Python commands one by one and executes them promptly.
The IPython shell is a luxury version of the simpler Python shell. It is also called *interactive mode* or *interactive Python command line*.

You can use any Python command from the *IPython Shell*:

    In [1]: 1 + 1
    Out[1]: 2
    In [2]: 4 * 16
    Out[2]: 64
    In [3]:

Results of each command are automatically printed to the screen.

#### How to leave the IPython shell?

* You can leave the command line by Ctrl-z (Windows) or Ctrl-d (Linux).
* If a program seems to be stuck, you can interrupt the shell with Ctrl-c.

### Integer numbers

The numerical values in the calculations are called **integers**. An integer is a number that has no decimal places. In Python, integers are a predefined **data type**.

Later, we will learn to know other kinds of numbers and data types.

### Operators

The arithmetical symbols like `+ - * /` connecting two integers are called **operators**. Generally, operators connect two values. 

## Exercises

### Exercise 2.1 Python statements

Which of the following Python statements are valid? Try them in the IPython shell.

    0 + 1
    2 3
    4-5
    6 * * 7
    8 /
    9
    
### Exercise 2.2 More operators

There are more operators in Python. Find out what the following operators do?

    3 ** 3
    24 % 5
    23 // 10

### Exercise 2.3 Calculations

Which operations result in 8?

- [ ] `65 // 8`
- [ ] `17 % 9`
- [ ] `2 ** 4`
- [ ] `64 ** 0.5`
