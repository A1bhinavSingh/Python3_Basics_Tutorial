# First steps on the Python Shell

## Overview

You can use any Python command from the interactive Python command line or *Python Shell*:

    >>> print(4**216)
    >>> a = 'blue'
    >>> print(a)
    blue
    >>>

Python works in the same way as it would in a program, except that results are automatically printed.
Define code blocks by indenting extra lines:

	>>> for i in range(3):
	...     print(i)
	...
	0
	1
	2
	>>> 

### Tips

* You can leave the command line by Ctrl-Z (Windows) or Ctrl-D (Linux).
* The CLI works great as a pocket calculator.
* Writing code blocks with 2+ lines in the CLI gets painful quickly.
* From IDLE, you can execute a program in the command line by pressing F5.
