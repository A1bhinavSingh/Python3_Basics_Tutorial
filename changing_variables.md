## 4. Changing variables

Let's change the content of some variables:

    In [1]: emily = 25952
    In [2]: emily = emily + 1
    In [3]: emily
    Out[3]: 25953
    In [4]: hannah = 23073
    In [5]: xitlalic = 5
    In [6]: all_babies = 0
    In [7]: all_babies = _____ + _____ + _____
    In [8]: all_babies
    Out[8]: 49031

## Definitions

### Changing variables

You may assign to the same variable name twice:

    In [1]: emily = 25952
    In [2]: emily = 25953
    In [3]: emily
    Out[3]: ______

In this case, the first value is overwritten. There is no way to obtain it.

### Python Statements

The lines you are writing all the time are also called Python **Statements**. A Statement is the smallest executable piece of code.

So far, you have seen at least three different kinds of statements:

* Calculate a number
* Put a number into a variable
* Print the number from a variable on the screen

In the next lessons, there will be lots of other statements.

## Exercises
