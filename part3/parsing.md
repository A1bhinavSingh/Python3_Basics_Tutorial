# Extracting information from a file

Rarely you can use the information from a file directly. Most of the time you will need to *parse* it, that is extracting relevant information.

Parsing means for instance:

* dividing tables into columns
* converting numbers to integers or floats.
* discarding unnecessary lines.

## The Challenge: Find Your name

Write a program that finds out how often your name occurs in the list of 2014 baby names and print that number.

### Extra Challenge:

* Calculate the total number of babies registered in 2014.
