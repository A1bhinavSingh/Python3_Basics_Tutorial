# Working with directories

To process bigger amounts of data, you will need to work on more than one file. Sometimes you don't know all the files in advance.

## The Challenge: count the files

Write a program that counts the number of files in the unzipped set of baby names. Have the program print that number.

Verify that the number is correct.

### Extra Challenges

* Read each of the files and count the total number of lines.
* Generate a message that tells you which file the program is reading.
* Find your name in the files with a program.
