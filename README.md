# Python 3 Basics Tutorial

This is a tutorial for novice programmers. You are the learner I had in mind when writing this tutorial if:

* you have worked a little with a different programming language like R, MATLAB or C.
* you have no programming experience at all
* you know Python well and would like to teach others

This tutorial works best if you follow the chapters and exercises step by step.

## The dataset of U.S. baby names

![Babynamen](images/baby.png)

The authorities of the United States have recorded the first names of all people born as U.S. citizens since 1880. The dataset is publicly available on [http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html
](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html). However for the protection of privacy only names used at least 5 times appear in the data.

Throughout this tutorial, we will work with this data.
