# Python 3 Basics Tutorial

This is a tutorial for novice programmers. You are the learner I had in mind when writing this tutorial if:

* you have worked a little with a different programming language like R, MATLAB or C.
* you have no programming experience at all
* you know Python well and would like to teach others

This tutorial works best if you follow the chapters and exercises step by step.
