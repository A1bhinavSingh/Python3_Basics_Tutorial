# Writing Python programs

Using the interactive IPython alone is exciting only for a while. To write more complex programs, you need to store your instructions in *programs*, so that you can *execute* them later.

In the second part of the tutorial, you will learn a basic set of Python commands. Theoretically, they are sufficient to write any program on the planet (this is called *Turing completeness*). 

Practically, you will need shortcuts that make programs prettier, faster, and less painful to write. We will save these shortcuts for the later parts.

## Goals

The new Python commands cover:

* How to write to the screen.
* How to read from the keyboard.
* How to repeat instructions.
* How to store many items in a list.
* How to make decisions.
