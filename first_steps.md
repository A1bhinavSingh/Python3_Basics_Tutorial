# First steps on the IPython Shell

There are two ways to use Python: The *interactive mode* or *IPython shell* and *writing programs*. In this part, we will use the interactive mode to store data on **U.S. baby names**.

## The dataset of U.S. baby names

![Babynamen](images/baby.png)

The authorities of the United States have recorded the first names of all people born as U.S. citizens since 1880. The dataset is publicly available on [http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html
](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html). However for the protection of privacy only names used at least 5 times appear in the data.

Throughout this tutorial, we will work with this data.

## Goals

In the first part, we will apply Python to a few very basic questions:

* How to store the number of babies with one particular name?
* How to add two numbers of babies together?
* How to store the name of a baby?
* How to combine a name and a number belonging to the same data record?
