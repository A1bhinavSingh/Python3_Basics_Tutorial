# First steps on the IPython Shell

There are two ways to use Python: The *interactive mode* or *IPython shell* and *writing programs*. We will use the interactive mode to store data on **U.S. baby names**.

In the first part of the tutorial, you will use the IPython shell to write simple commands.


## Goals

The commands on the IPython shell cover:

* How to store a number?
* How to add two numbers together?
* How to store text?
* How to convert a number to text and back?
