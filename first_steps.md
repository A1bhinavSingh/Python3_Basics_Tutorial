# First steps on the IPython Shell

There are two ways to use Python: The *interactive mode* or *IPython shell* and *writing programs*. In this part, you will use the IPython shell to write simple commands.

We will use the interactive mode to store data on **U.S. baby names**.

## Goals

In the first part, we will apply Python to a few very basic questions:

* How to store the number of babies with one particular name?
* How to add two numbers of babies together?
* How to store the name of a baby?
* How to combine a name and a number belonging to the same data record?
