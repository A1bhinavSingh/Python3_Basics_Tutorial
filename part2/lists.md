# Storing lists of items

To handle larger amounts of data, we cannot invent a new variable for every new data item. Somehow we need to put more data into one variable. This is where Python lists come in.

## The Challenge: Percentage of top 10 names

For 2000, a total of 1962406 boys were registered born in the U.S. What percentage of that is made by the top 10 names?

Write a program to calculate that number.

| name    | number |
|---------|--------|
| Jacob | 34465 |
| Michael | 32025 |
| Matthew | 28569 |
| Joshua | 27531 |
| Christopher | 24928 |
| Nicholas | 24650 |
| Andrew | 23632 |
| Joseph | 22818 |
| Daniel | 22307 |
| Tyler | 21500 |

## Hint

If you are using Python2, you need to specify whether you want numbers with decimal places when dividing. That means

    3 / 4 

gives a different result than
 
    3.0 / 4

However, Python 3 automatically creates the decimal places if needed.
