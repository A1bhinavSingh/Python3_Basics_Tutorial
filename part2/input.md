# Reading from the keyboard

Next, we will connect the keyboard to our program.

## Warming up

What happens when you write the follwing lines in the IPython shell:

    In  [1]: a = input()
    In  [2]: a

## Exercise 1

Which `input` statements are correct?

- [ ] `a = input()`
- [ ] `a = input("enter a number")`
- [ ] `a = input(enter your name)`
- [ ] `a = input(3)`


## The Challenge: Enter a baby name

Write a program that asks for a *name* and an *age*, then writes a sentence with the entered data:

    Bobby is 3 years old.

### Extra challenge:

* Add 1 to the age entered.
