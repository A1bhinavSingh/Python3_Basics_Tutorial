# Warming up

Open a text editor window (*not a Python console*). Type: 

    print("Hannah")
    print(23073)

Now save the text to a file with the name `first_program.py`.

Then run the program. 

* In **Canopy**, you do this by pressing the 'play' button.
* In **IDLE**, you can execute a program by pressing F5.
* On **Unix**, you go open a terminal (*a regular one, not IPython*) and write:

    python3 first_program.py
