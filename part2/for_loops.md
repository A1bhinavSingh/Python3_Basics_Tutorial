# Repeating instructions

So far, each Python instruction was executed only once. That makes programming a bit useless, because our programs are limited by our typing speed.

In this section you will learn the `for` statements that repeats one or more instructions several times.

## The Challenge: count characters

Write a program that calculates the number of characters in `Emily Smith`.

### Extra challenge

* Duplicate each character, so that `Emily` becomes `EEmmiillyy`.
