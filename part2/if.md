# Making decisions

The last missing piece in our basic set of commands is the ability to make decisions in a program. This is done in Python using the `if` command.

## The Challenge: Filter a list

You have a list of the top 20 girls names from 2000:

    ['Emily', 'Hannah', 'Madison', 'Ashley', 'Sarah', 
    'Alexis', 'Samantha', 'Jessica', 'Elizabeth', 'Taylor', 
    'Lauren', 'Alyssa', 'Kayla', 'Abigail', 'Brianna', 
    'Olivia', 'Emma', 'Megan', 'Grace', 'Victoria']

Write a program that prints all names that start with an `A`.

### Extra challenge

* count the number of names starting with `A` and print that number as well.
