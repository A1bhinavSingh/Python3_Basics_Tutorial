# Background information on Python 3

## What is Python?

* Python is an interpreted language.
* Python uses dynamic typing.
* Python 3 is not compatible to Python 2.x
* The Python interpreter generates intermediate code 
(in the __pycache__ directory).

## Strengths

* Quick to write, no compilation
* Fully object-oriented
* Many reliable libraries
* All-round language
* 100% free software

## Weaknesses

* Writing very fast programs is not straightforward
* No strict encapsulation

## What has changed from Python 2 to Python 3?

* print is now a function
* all Strings are stored in Unicode (better handling of umlauts and special characters in all languages)
* many functions like *zip(), map() and filter() return iterators*
* the standard library has been cleaned up completely
