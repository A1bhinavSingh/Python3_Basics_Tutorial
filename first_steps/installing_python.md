# Installing Python

The first step into programming is to get Python installed on your computer. You will need two things

* Python itself
* a text editor

A convenient way to install Python, an editor and many additional packages in one go is [**Anaconda**](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/), a Python distribution with many pre-installed packages for scientific applications.

After installing, you will need to launch the **Spyder** editor from the Start menu.


### Other Python environments

* [**Python 3**](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - the standard Python installation
* **Idle** - a standard editor installed with Python by default.
* **Atom**
* **PyCharm** - a professional Python development environment capable of handling large projects. You won't need most of the functionality for a long time, but it is a well-written editor.
* **vim** - a console-based text editor for Unix systems. The tool of choice for many system administrators.
