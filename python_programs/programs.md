# My first program

Using the interactive IPython shell alone is exciting only for a while. To write more complex programs, you need to store your instructions in *programs*, so that you can *execute* them later.

In this section we will write our first Python program. It is going to simply write a few names of babies to the screen.

### Exercise 1

Open a text editor (e.g. Spyder) and create a new file. Write into it: 

    print("Hannah")
    print(23073)

Save the file with the name `output.py` ab.

### Exercise 2

Now let's execute our program.

* In **Anaconda Spyder** you can use the *"Play"* button or press `F5`.
* In **Unix** open a terminal, change to the directory with the Python file and type:

    python3 output.py


### Exercise 3

Explain the following program:

    name = "Emily"
    jahr = 2000
    print(name, jahr)


### Exercise 4

Write the following program:

    name = "Emily"
    name

What happens when you execute the code?
