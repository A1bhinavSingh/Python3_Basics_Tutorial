# Screen output

In this chapter we will explor the `print()` function to write text to the screen.


### Exercise 1

Which `print` statements are correct?

* `print("9" + "9")`
* `print "nine"`
* `print(str(9) + "nine")`
* `print(9 + 9)`
* `print(nine)`


### Exercise 2

Explain the following statement:

    print("Emily\tSmith\n2000")

### Exercise 3

Some babies have names similar to celebrities. Write a program producing the following output:

    Harry      Hermione      Severus
    Tyrion     Daenerys      Frodo
    Luke       Leia          Darth

### Exercise 4

Expand the previous exercise so that:

* only a single `print` statement is used.
* the names are stored in a variable before building the string.
