# Storing numbers

The U.S. authorities record the names of all babies born since 1880. How many babies with more or less popular names were born in 2000? Let's store the numbers in *variables*. 

## Warming up

Let's define some variables:

    In [1]: emily = 25952
    In [2]: hannah = 23073
    In [3]: khaleesi = 5
    In [4]: emily
    Out[4]: ______
    In [5]: hannah + 1
    Out[5]: ______
    In [6]: 3 * khaleesi
    Out[6]: ______

Let's change the content:

    In [7]: emily = emily + 1
    In [8]: emily
    Out[8]: _____

    In [9]: all_babies = 0
    In [10]: all_babies = _____ + _____ + _____
    In [11]: all_babies
    Out[11]: 49031

Insert the correct values and variable names into the blanks.

## Exercises

- [ ] `seven = 3 * 4`


## The Challenge: Calculate an average

What is the average number of the top five boy names? 

Calculate the number and store it in a variable.

Make a very rough estimate before you do the calculation.
