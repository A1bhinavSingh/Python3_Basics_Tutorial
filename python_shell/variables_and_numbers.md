# Storing numbers

The U.S. authorities record the names of all babies born since 1880. How many babies with more or less popular names were born in 2000? Let's store the numbers in *variables*. 

### Exercise 1:

Let's define some variables. Fill in the gaps:

    In [1]: emily = 25952
    In [2]: hannah = 23073
    In [3]: khaleesi = 5
    In [4]: emily
    Out[4]: ______
    In [5]: hannah + 1
    Out[5]: ______
    In [6]: 3 * khaleesi
    Out[6]: ______

### Exercise 2:

Let's change the content. Insert the correct values and variable names into the blanks.

    In [7]: emily = emily + 1
    In [8]: emily
    Out[8]: _____

    In [9]: all_babies = 0
    In [10]: all_babies = _____ + _____ + _____
    In [11]: all_babies
    Out[11]: 49031

*If you like maths, you may sigh loud at the notion of redefining a variable every few lines.*

### Exercise 3:

Which of the following variable names are correct? Try assigning some numbers to them.

    Sarah
    ASHLEY
    madison alexis
    sam90
    2000jessy
    liz_lauren
    alyssa.kay

### Exercise 4:

Which are correct variable assignments?

* `a = 1 * 2`
* `2 = 1 + 1`
* `5 + 6 = y`
* `seven = 3 * 4`
