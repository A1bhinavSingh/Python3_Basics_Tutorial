# Variables and numbers

## Variables
Variables are *'named boxes'* used to store values within a Python program.
Variable names may be composed of letters, underscores and, after the first position, also digits.
Lowercase letters are common, but uppercase is also allowed (usually used for constants).

    invitation = 'Hello World'
    a = 10
    b = 3.0
    PI = 3.1415

## Arithmetical operations
Basic operations and variable assignments:

    a = 7
    b = 4
    c = a - b      # 3
    d = a * b      # 28
    e = a / b      # 1
    f = a % b      # modulo, 3
    g = a ** 2     # 49   
    h = 3.0 / b    # 0.75
    i = 7.0 // b   # floor division, 1.0
