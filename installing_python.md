## 1. Installing Python

The first step into programming is to get Python installed on your computer. You will need two things

1. Python itself
2. a text editor

Which to install, depends on your operating system.

### On Ubuntu Linux

By default, Python is already installed. In this tutorial however, we will use Python3 whenever possible. You can install it from a terminal window with: 

    sudo apt-get install python3
    sudo apt-get install ipython3

To check whether everything worked, type:

    ipython3

As a text editor, it is fine to start with **gedit**. Please make sure to change tabs to spaces via *Edit -> Preferences -> Editor -> tick 'Insert spaces instead of tabs'*.

### On Windows

A convenient way to install Python, an editor and many additional packages in one go is [**Canopy**](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/). Download and install it from the website.

After installing, you will need to set up Canopy from the Start menu. Select the first item from the **Enthought Canopy** group and click through the dialog.

### Other Python distributions

* [**Python 3**](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - the standard Python installation
* [**Anaconda**](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) - a Python distribution with many pre-installed packages for scientific applications

#### Other editors

* **Idle** - the standard editor
* **Sublime Text** - a very powerful text editor for all operating systems
* **Notepad++** - a powerful text editor for Windows. *Please do not use the standard Notepad. It won't get you anywhere.*
* **PyCharm** - a professional Python development environment capable of handling large projects. You won't need most of the functionality for a long time, but it is a well-written editor.
* **vim** - a console-based text editor for Unix systems. The tool of choice for many system administrators.

### Exercises
