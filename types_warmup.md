# Warming up

Now we are going to combine strings with integer numbers.

    name = 'Emily Smith'
    born = _____
    ____ = '15'

    text = ____ + ' was born in the year ' + _____
    year = born + _____
    text
    year

Insert into the following items into the code, so that all statements are working: `age`, `int(age)`, name, `str(born)`, `2000`

### Questions

* Can you leave `str(born)` and `int(age)` away?
* What do `str()` and `int()` do?
