# Converting numbers to text and back

Now you know how to store numbers and how to store text. Being able to convert the two into each other will come in handy. For that, we will use *type conversions*.

## The Challenge: A data record with types

| field      | value    | type |
|------------|----------|------|
| first name | Andrew   | string |
| last name  | O'Malley | string |
| gender     | M | string |
| year of birth | 2000  | integer |
| age | 15 | integer |

Write the values from each row of the table into string or integer variables, then combine them to a single one-line string.
