The authorities of the United States have recorded the first names of all people born as U.S. citizens since 1880. The dataset is publicly available on [http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html
](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html). However for the protection of privacy only names used at least 5 times appear in the data.

Throughout this tutorial, we will work with this data.
